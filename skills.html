    </h1>

            I used to run a Roblox channel when I was addicted to Roblox over the pandemic. Sadly, I'm not addicted to Roblox anymore.
            However, I will share with you the biggest tips to creating a successful Youtube video!!! - Attatched below is a video from 
            one of my Youtube channels! If you choose to watch it, I recommend setting your volume to very low, as there is background 
            music!

            1: Know Your Audience
        </span>
    </h2>
    <p style="font-size:20px;">
        <span>
            This is 100% the most important part! If you don't know your audience, you won't know how to appeal to them! If you want to make 
            a college acceptance reactions video and use it to get popular, then your audience will be mostly high school freshmen to seniors! 
            You must alter your sense of humor accordingly, and not sound pretentious! There are many factors to consider, but you must at least 
            understand who your audience is and how they think! For the sake of clarity, I will be creating a college acceptance reactions video 
            foundation for this website!

            2: Create a Captivating Thumbnail
        </span>
    </h2>
    <p style="font-size:20px;">
        <span>
            The thumbnail is the first thing the consumer will see! You absolutely have to make it captivating, making use of what
            your audience is interested in! If you need a good thumbnail creator, you can use Canva! It's free, and has a lot of features!
            Here are some pointers for making a good thumbnail:
        </span>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Try not let your thumbnail's text be COMPLETELY identical to the video title! Change it up by 1 or 2 words!</li>
        <li>Show open-sourced images relating to your video's topic! Make sure they are relevant and easy-to-read!</li>
        <li>Make your thumbnail simple. Anyone that scrolls by should be able to understand it!</li>   
        <li>
            Clickbait is okay, but don't do it to the point of it becoming unethical! You want to get views, but you don't
            want your viewer to leave the video within the first second! That will only hurt your video's chances of success!
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="font-size:40px;">
        <span>
            3: Play the Right Music
        </span>
    </h2>
    <p style="font-size:20px;">
        <span>
            Good background music is integral for increasing your watch time! You must know your audience to know what music to put 
            in the background. If you were a Roblox youtuber, you could consider putting non-copyright EDM songs. For college reaction 
            videos, you would usually want to use lofi or calm music, to lower the heartrate of your consumer. I've attatched an example
            of a lofi song. Please properly credit the music you use in the description.

            4: Analyze Your Statistics!
        </span>
    </h2>
    <p style="font-size:20px;">
        <span>
            Statistics are extremely important! If you're making your first video, you don't have to worry about this. However, if you 
            have 1 or more videos uploaded, you can check out your analytics! By analyzing these, you can see how people found you, and 
            get a good idea of the type of audience you have! Once you get into the brains of your audience, you can make sure your videos
            appeal to them, and they might come back and even subscribe! Below is an example of statistics from my past 30 days!
        </span>
    </p>
    <img src="Images/Analytics YT.png" alt="YT Analytics showing -100 subscribers" width="480" height="270">    
    <p style="font-size:20px;">
        I have not uploaded in 2 years, so the analytics tell me that I should consider uploading if I want to achieve better audience 
        retention!
