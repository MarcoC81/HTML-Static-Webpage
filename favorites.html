            I have a lot of things that I like to do in my free time! I'll share some of them here!!!!!

        <span>SAXOPHONE</span>
    </h2>
    <p style="font-size:25px;">
        <span>
            I love playing the alto saxophone! I've played it since 6th grade, and I still play it today. I always like instruments that work 
            well as solo-instruments, and I think the alto saxophone fits that very well! My skill level is far from advanced on the saxophone, 
            but I'm still able to sight-read popular songs if I ever feel like it!

        <span>ONE PIECE</span>
    </h2>
    <p style="font-size:25px;">
        <span>
            I love One Piece. I started it last summer. I reached episode 1000 in just 6 months after last summer ended. I really like the unique story
            that Eiichiro Oda created for One Piece, and I definitely love Luffy's rubber power. One Piece was what made physics class so much fun 
            for me, because I could keep on comparing Luffy's attacks with the workings of physics!!!

        <span>Martial Arts</span>
    </h2>
    <p style="font-size:25px;">
        <span>
            My form is not good and my balance is very off. However, I practice punching and kicking for fun, and use it more as 
            a form of exercise rather than a formal skill. I'm the best martial artist in my dojo! (my dojo is the backyard and I 
            am the only person in the backyard) Bruce Lee's kicking is my end goal, but I know I won't exactly reach that point. 
            Self-learning martial arts is my 100% favorite exercise, even if I'm not good at it!!!!!

        <span>ROBOTICS</span>
    </h2>
    <p style="font-size:25px;">
        <span>
            I'm trying to build a pill counter using a Raspberry Pi. I've seen pill counters cost around $8,000 along with over 
            $1,000 in yearly maitenance. I wanted to try to build a prototype for a cost-effective model, and I settled on a rotating 
            disc attatched to a motor! So far I have yet to complete it, but I believe it will be 100% done by next month!

        My current progress - It's a mess right now but I've only just begun! Please don't judge I've never used Raspberry Pi before
