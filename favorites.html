            I have a lot of things that I like to do in my free time! I'll share some of them here!!!!!

        <span>SAXOPHONE</span>
    </h2>
    <p style="font-size:20px;">
        <span>
            I love playing the alto saxophone! I've played it since 6th grade, and I still play it today. I always like instruments that work 
            well as solo-instruments, and I think the alto saxophone fits that very well! My skill level is far from advanced on the saxophone, 
            but I'm still able to sight-read popular songs if I ever feel like it! Careless Whisper is the only song I have memorized.

        <span>ONE PIECE</span>
    </h2>
    <p style="font-size:20px;">
        <span>
            I love One Piece. I started it last summer. I reached episode 1000 in just 6 months after last summer ended. I really like the unique story
            that Eiichiro Oda created for One Piece, and I definitely love Luffy's rubber power. One Piece was what made physics class so much fun 
            for me, because I could keep on comparing Luffy's attacks with the workings of physics!!! Though, I'm now in AP Physics C: Mechanics
            and I can no longer compare Luffy's attacks to physics without having to go into a lot of calculus numbers D:

        <span>Martial Arts</span>
    </h2>
    <p style="font-size:20px;">
        <span>
            My form is not good and my balance is very off. However, I practice punching and kicking for fun, and use it more as 
            a form of exercise rather than a formal skill. I'm the second best martial artist in the backyard because my dad is better 
            than me! Bruce Lee is my inspiration, and I know I won't ever reach his point. However, I'll keep practicing because it's 100% 
            my favorite exercise! (The question-mark kick is my favorite kick!!)

    </h2>
    <p style="font-size:20px;">
        <span>
            I'm trying to build a pill counter using a Raspberry Pi. I've seen pill counters cost around $8,000 along with over 
            $1,000 in yearly maitenance. I wanted to try to build a prototype for a cost-effective model, and I settled on a rotating 
            disc attatched to a motor! So far I have yet to complete it, but I believe it will be 100% done by next month!

        My current progress - That big screen in the background is a 20 year-old Element TV! It displays the Raspbian OS very well
        (I don't know how to program on the command line) :D

        1 week later update: The extremely unsanitary pill counter can now accurately count with certain limitations! It has a very 
        very basic Python GUI and I hope to finish the entire project soon! (Did you notice the final pill that fell out because of the
        reverse rotation at the end? Don't worry, those pills weren't formally prescribed for anyone! :D)

        2 week later update: I moved the sensor so it counts more accurately and I added a spiral filter! Though, it's still extremely 
        unsanitary and those pills will never be prescribed again!!!
